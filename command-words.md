# Commands Words

Command words are the words and phrases used in exams and other
assessment tasks that tell students how they should answer the question.

 - **Show that**
    - Construct a logical argument that shows that the given information leads to the
printed result.

- **Prove that**
    - Requires rigour. Formal use of the methods of mathematical argument is being
assessed, eg ‘Prove by contradiction that…’, ‘Prove by induction that…’.
Sometimes will refer to a standard result for the specification.

- **Verify that**
    - Requires a demonstration that something is correct or incorrect in a given case.

- **Deduce that**
    - Like ‘Show that’ except that it specifically indicates that a previous result (or
results) in the question is relevant.

- **Find/determine**
    - Obtain an answer.

- **Work out/calculate**
    - A calculation or calculations are required.

- **Write down/state/give**
    - Intermediate working out will not be expected and should not be necessary.

- **Explain**
    - A written explanation is required, although this can include, or be substantially, arithmetic, algebraic, diagrammatic or graphical work as appropriate.

- **Factorise**
    - Write the expression as a product of irreducible factors.

- **Express**
    - Give an answer in the form described in the question.

- **Simplify**
    - Cancel down fractions (possibly algebraic), collect like terms and use standard simplifying results from within the specification (eg ln e = 1).

- **Solve**
    - Find all values that satisfy the given equation or inequality.

- **Expand**
    Multiply out using the distributive law or binomial theorem.

- **Differentiate**
    - Find the derivative of.

- **Integrate**
    - Find the integral of.

- **Describe**
    - Give full details of.

- **Sketch**
    - A sketch need not be a completely accurate drawing, but should illustrate all the significant features of the graph/shape.

- **Draw**
    - Draw neatly and accurately.

- **Plot**
    - Accurately place points on a graph.

- **Name**
    - Give the technical term for.

- **Construct**
    - Use appropriate information or premises to form (may be related to proof).

- **Estimate**
    - Perform a calculation leading to an approximate answer.

- **Forecast**
    - Assuming the current trend continues, find.

- **Investigate/examine/test/carry out (a test)**
    - Inquire into eg by performing a hypothesis test that will lead to a conclusion relating to the context of the question. May be used in other contexts apart from statistics, eg 'examine the argument…'

- **Interpret**
    - Determine what the results mean in the context of the question.

- **Justify**
    - Give working or reasons to support your answers.

- **Comment on**
    - Describe a notable feature of the situation in the question.

- **Compare**
    - Describe the significant similarities or differences between.

- **Advise/instruct**
    - What does the person in the question need to know? What would you tell them  if you were able?
